Allegiance Forms: Future?
	
Ideas:
Neutral ships/bases/space monsters?
Destroyed bases leave salvage?
Multiple resources (ala Gass in SC2)

Gameplay
Story Campaign
Better UI: shortcut buttons

Technology
Support small screens & touch controls
Multiplayer: Instance game logic, server runs simulation, sends clients updates

Balance
Capital ships not requiring pilots - allows an economy to win easily. Too cheap & quick... Too much starting money?

Another Simpler AI
2 missions at a time, group ships up
always build refineries if have He3 rocks
1 tech at a time (50% home tech, 50% next door), fully upgrade in order.
bombers first, then focus on next tech.
50% chance at SY, group 4+ caps


3. Start multiplayer
4. Write a campaign story

Redo sound effects
