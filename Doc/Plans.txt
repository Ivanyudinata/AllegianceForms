Allegiance Forms: Plans

Quick Commands organising units - Practise! 
 Does it feel more like the original? 
 Is it quicker & less precise?
 How about across sectors?
 Squadrons/Wings group?
 Setup Missions? No - just order, switch sectors and repeat
 
 
Multiplayer!!
 Server: Listen & Accept connections
 Client: Connect & send commands
 Server: Send commands & Updates

Optimise!!
 30fps minimum
 Enable CPU profiling & check what is poor
 
Campaign!!
 Flesh out the colony ship idea - Story points for each, important characters, backgrounds, sub cultures. How would they evolve during the journey?
 Faction presets - setup differences & faction names for each. How would the flag evolve?
 Scrolling text scenes initially, animations later?
 Gameplay within the colony ship? (Management sim? Clicker? Match3? Typing game? Tower defence? Card battle game? Rummy-style card game? Board game? Tetris? Breakout? Pong? Space invaders? Racing?, Frogger? Trading game? Stock Market sim?)
 Gameplay on the planet? (Alpha Centuri? Mushroom wars?)
 Discover worm holes >> Gameplay in space (Allegiance)
 Branching decisions & game results leading to at least 2 endings. You can retry if you loose, or choose to progress with limited choices.
 
 
 
 

	
Ideas:
Destroyed bases leave salvage?
Multiple resources (ala Gass in SC2)

Gameplay
Story Campaign
Better UI: shortcut buttons

Technology
Support small screens & touch controls
Multiplayer: Instance game logic, server runs simulation, sends clients updates

Balance
Capital ships not requiring pilots - allows an economy to win easily. Too cheap & quick... Too much starting money?

Another Simpler AI
2 missions at a time, group ships up
always build refineries if have He3 rocks
1 tech at a time (50% home tech, 50% next door), fully upgrade in order.
bombers first, then focus on next tech.
50% chance at SY, group 4+ caps


3. Start multiplayer
4. Write a campaign story

Redo sound effects
