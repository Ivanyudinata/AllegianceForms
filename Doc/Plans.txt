Allegiance Forms: Future?

Gameplay
Interesting, easier AI with more end game variations

Better graphics, particle effects, sounds.
Better UI: more notifications, shortcut buttons, mini map.

Balance
Capital ships not requiring pilots - allows an economy to win easily. Too cheap & quick... Too much starting money?


Neutral ships/bases/space monsters?
Destroyed bases leave salvage?
Simpler/Variant AI

3. Start multiplayer
